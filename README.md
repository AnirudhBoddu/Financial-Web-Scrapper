# Financial-Web-Scrapper
Web Scraping is a technique to simulate the behavior of a website user to effectively use the website itself as a web service to retrieve data. Scraping can gather data/information from World Wide Web and you can get data as per your requirements. Investors need to have a comprehensive data of similar companies and their corresponding stock values which appear in the stock market every day. Web Scraper software can be used to keep a constant watch on this data. You can get all the required information from a financial source at the click of a button. In this project we scraped financial data from a financial website. The scraped data is parsed using Beautiful soup object. The extracted information is emailed in the form of pie chart and used by investors for analysis.
